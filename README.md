# Diabetes-Prediction-App
A Streamlit-based Machine Learning web application that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using trained ML models. Built for educational and project purposes, demonstrating end-to-end ML deployment from model training to live prediction.

## Developed By : sayali Khairnar

## Functions
- Takes input values such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, etc.
- Preprocesses the input data before prediction
- Uses Machine Learning algorithm to predict diabetes
- Displays prediction result as diabetic or non-diabetic
- Shows prediction confidence in percentage
- Provides interactive UI using Streamlit
